# Steampunk Watch Landing Page
This was made with Three.js & GSAP. I wanted to try out incorporating 3D models onto a website, particularly for a steampunk wristwatch.

## Challenges Faced 
Some challenges I faced were: 
<ul>
  <li>Improving performance for mobile devices, so I reduced the light sources, shadow resolution, and removed anti-aliasing</li>
  <li>Aligning the stripes behind the 3D model based on the user agent's (browser) width.</li>
</ul>

## Project setup
If you want to try this out for yourself, download the source code, open the folder in VSCode/VSCodium, and run these lines of code.
```
pnpm install
```

### Compiles and hot-reloads for development
```
pnpm run dev
```
