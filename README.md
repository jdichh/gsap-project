# Steampunk Watch Landing Page
This was made with Three.js & GSAP. I wanted to try out incorporating 3D models onto a website, particularly for a certain product.

The main challenges I faced were how to improve performance for mobile devices, and how to align the stripes behind the 3D model based on the user's screen resolution.
