# Steampunk Watch Landing Page
This was made with Three.js & GSAP. I wanted to try out incorporating 3D models onto a website, particularly for a steampunk wristwatch.

## Challenges Faced 
Some challenges I faced were: 
<ul>
  <li>How to improve performance for mobile devices, so I reduced the light sources, shadow resolution, and removed anti-aliasing and;</li>
  <li>How to align the stripes behind the 3D model based on the user agent's (browser) width.</li>
</ul>
